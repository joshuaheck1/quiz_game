<p> I present to you my first Python project! This is the first of many Python projects to come as I dive in head first to learn this highly versatile programming language. The project is a simple text-base slot machine. I added some minor flair and cleaned up the spacing to make it a littler easier on the eyes. As I learn more about Python, I'll do another run at this project to see how far I can push it.
